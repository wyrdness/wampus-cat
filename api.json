      "full": "The Wampus Cat is a fearsome critter that blends authentic Cherokee mythology with American frontier tall tales. Described as a six-legged panther-like creature, the Wampus Cat roams the Appalachian Mountains with supernatural speed. The Cherokee origin story tells of a woman who spied on sacred ceremonies while wearing a mountain lion skin; as punishment, she was transformed into the Wampus Cat. Lumberjacks and frontiersmen adapted this into their fearsome critter tradition, embellishing the creature with additional legs and exaggerated ferocity. Unlike purely invented critters, the Wampus Cat has roots in genuine Indigenous folklore, making it a cultural hybrid."
