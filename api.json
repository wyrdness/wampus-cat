      "full": "The Wampus Cat is unique among fearsome critters because it blends authentic Cherokee mythology with American frontier tall tales. Described as a six-legged mountain cat with supernatural speed, the Wampus Cat roams the Appalachian Mountains. In Cherokee tradition, the Wampus Cat originated as a woman who violated sacred law by spying on male ceremonial rituals while disguised in a mountain lion skin. As punishment, she was transformed into a half-woman, half-cat creature. American frontiersmen and lumberjacks adapted this legend, adding extra legs and exaggerating the creature's ferocity to fit the fearsome critter mold."
